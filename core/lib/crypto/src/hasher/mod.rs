/// This structure expects input data to be correct, as it's main usage is the Merkle tree maintenance,
/// which assumes the consistent state.
/// It means that caller is responsible for checking that input values are actually valid, e.g. for `Vec<u8>`
/// it must be checked that byte sequence can be deserialized to hash object expected by the chosen hasher
/// implementation.
///
/// What it *actually* means, that is incorrect input data will cause the code to panic.
